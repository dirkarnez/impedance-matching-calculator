### Notes
- Psource = Vsource * Icircuit
    - Psource = Vsource^2 / (Rth + Rload)
        - (Rth + Rload) increase = less Psource = not efficient
        - (Rth + Rload) decrease = more Icircuit = overcurrent = excessive generation of heat, and the risk of fire or damage to equipment
            - Since Rth is a constant value (labelled impedance on the case of guitar cabinet), Rload should not be smaller than expected
                - real life scenero: blow up a guitar cabinet                
        - Rth = Rload = matched impedance = get the most from Psource

> The choice of loudspeaker impedance, such as 4 ohms, is based on

>  loudspeaker get more power by gettting more current instead of
